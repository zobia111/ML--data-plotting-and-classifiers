1. Plotting the Data
   
Plot the probability of Y=miss for each distance.

Plot the probability of Player 1 attempting a shot from each distance.

Plot the probability of Player 2 attempting a shot from each distance.

3. Calculating the Likelihood
    
Assume that you randomly select 5 shots from the data for each distance. Plot the probability of obtaining the sequence {miss, miss, score, miss, score} using a bar plot.

6. Posterior Analysis
   
3.1 Posterior Distribution by Distance

For Player 1 attempting shots from a distance d, plot the posterior distribution over each distance under the following scenarios:

Player 1 attempts a shot from d, and he scores.

Player 1 attempts 3 shots from d, and he scores all of them.

Player 1 attempts 5 shots from d, and he scores 2 of them and misses 3 of them.

Player 1 attempts 40 shots from d, and he scores 15 of them and misses 25 of them.

3.2 Marginalization

Given the outcomes of shots, plot the posterior distribution over different distances.

Given the outcomes of shots, plot the posterior distribution over different players.

4. Maximum Posterior Estimation

Which distance has the largest posterior?

Which player has the largest posterior?

5. Naive Bayes Classifier

Train a Naive Bayes classifier using all the data in the training set.

6. Extended Naive Bayes Classifier with Additive Smoothing

Extend your classifier to compute a MAP estimate of θ parameters using a fair Dirichlet prior with additive smoothing (α=1).

Train the extended classifier using all the training sets.

Classify all the test sets and report the test-set classification accuracy.
